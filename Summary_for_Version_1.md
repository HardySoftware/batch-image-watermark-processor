# About This Project #
This project was created in Microsoft .Net 2.0 in C# language.

My next step of plan is to rewrite the entire application in Microsoft .Net Framework 3.5 Presentation Foundation. I won't add new features to current version unless there are some major bugs. I will try to include all major changes to my next version which is in WPF.
